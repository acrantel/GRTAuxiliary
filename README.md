# GRTAuxiliary

This repo contains code for GRT's vision and LIDAR processing pipelines. Both programs run on our [NVIDIA® Jetson Nano™](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit). 

Our vision code is written in Python and utilizes OpenCV to process a video stream and detect the Power Port in FRC Infinite Recharge. Our LiDAR is an [RPLIDAR A1](https://www.slamtec.com/en/Lidar/A1), a 2D LIDAR system with a 6 meter range. LIDAR code is written in C++ and utilizes OpenCV and the [RPLIDAR SDK](https://github.com/Slamtec/rplidar_sdk) for C++.
